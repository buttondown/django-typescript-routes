# django-typescript-routes

Meant as a spiritual successor to [django-js-reverse](https://pypi.org/project/django-js-reverse/), `django-typescript-routes` is meant to answer to the following question:

> I've got a Typescript-based SPA that is powered by a Django-based API. How do I safely make requests to Django without messing up the routes or parameters?

`django-typescript-routes` is how! At a high level, it turns:

```python
urls = [
    path(
        r"about",
        about,
        name="about",
    ),
    path(
        r"/<str:username>",
        subscribe,
        name="subscribe",
    ),
    path(
        r"/<str:username>/subscribers/<pk:uuid>/success",
        subscription_success,
        name="subscription-success",
    ),
]
```

into:

```typescript
const URLS = {
  about: () => `/`,
  subscribe: (username: string) => `/${username}`,
  "subscription-success": (username: string, pk: string) =>
    `/${username}/subscribers/${pk}/success`,
};
```

## Quick start
